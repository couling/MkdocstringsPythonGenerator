# mkdocstrings-python-generator

mkdocstrings-python-generator is a mkdocs plugin for generating markdown pages automatically from python source code.

It is intended to fill a gap which is currently left to each user of mkdoctstings-python.  Namely: generating markdown
files for each python file.

_Note despite the name, there is no affiliation between mkdocstrings and mkdocstrings-python-generator. Please try to 
determine which plugin is to blame before posting issues [here](https://github.com/couling/MkdocstringsPythonGenerator/issues) or [there](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/python)._


## Features

Its advantages over the [mkdocstrings-python recipe](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/recipes/#automatic-code-reference-pages) are:

 - âœ… Easier to use (no writing code for yourself)
 - âœ… Well formatted nav out of the box. Package names with underscores are not title case ðŸ“¦
 - âœ… Compatibility with both explicit nav defined in mkdocs.yaml and implicit nav with no definition in mkdocs.yaml
 - âœ… Supports `__init__.py` files as [section indexes](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#section-index-pages) if supported by the theme.
 - âœ… Edit URI compatible with both `edit_uri` and `edit_uri_template`
