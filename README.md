# mkdocstrings-python-generator

mkdocstrings-python-generator is a mkdocs plugin for generating markdown pages automatically from python source code.

It is intended to fill a gap which is currently left to each user of mkdoctstings-python.  Namely: generating markdown
files for each python file.

_Note despite the name there is no affiliation between mkdocstrings and mkdocstrings-python-generator. Please try to 
determine which plugin is to blame before posting issues here or [there](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/python)._

## Project Status
